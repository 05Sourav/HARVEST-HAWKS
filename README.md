# Hack-Heritage
Designed and implemented an AI-powered drone solution for apple orchard management in Himachal Pradesh, integrating YOLOv8 for apple detection and VGG16/ResNet50 models to monitor fruit freshness and leaf health. The system processes data through a Raspberry Pi, providing real-time insights via an interactive dashboard that supports pest control, yield estimation, and disease management. Key metrics include a validation accuracy of 97.59% with ResNet50, a validation accuracy of 97.03% with VGG16 and a YOLOv8 mAP50 score of 91%. Planned upgrades include solar-powered charging, dynamic collision avoidance, terrain-adaptive landing gear, and fog-penetrating cameras, making this solution a powerful tool for precision agriculture.

We are continually working to enhance our modelâ€™s performance to make this solution even more effective and reliable. Currently, we are focused on hyperparameter tuning, experimenting with various data augmentation techniques, and exploring other optimization methods to improve detection accuracy, recall, and overall robustness. By iteratively testing and refining these models, we aim to find the optimal configurations that maximize our metrics and ensure precise monitoring of apple health and orchard conditions. This project is a work in progress, and we're committed to developing the best possible version to bring unparalleled efficiency to orchard management.
